## Introduction

**Always create a branch as a first step!** Creating a branch is one of the most essential best practices for working in a repository. It lets you easily collaborate with larger groups, organize your work, and work in isolation.

**develop**: It is standard practice to do active development on a branch called "develop", as follows:

    git branch develop
    git checkout develop
    git push origin develop

This creates a new branch from your current working branch, switches to that branch, and then pushes the new branch to the remote repository (GitHub).

To save your changes, always make sure you are on your development branch:

    git checkout develop

    <work on your assignment>

    git add <new or changed files>
    git commit -m "A descriptive note of what you changed"
    git push origin develop

When you are done, open a PR requesting your develop branch be merged to master.
The time and date of your pull request from develop into master will determine your submission time. See the lab manual for details.
